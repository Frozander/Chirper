Why?

I added this Contribution guideline file just for the sake of it. But if you want to contribute this is where you can see what I care about.

What?
---

This project does not include a CoC or anything like that (rightfully so). So no need for bloated and useless cordialities. You can see the source code and easily deduce the style, I would rather you stick to it.
However, writing usefull, bloat-free and fast code is what I care about the most in general. So as long as it fits I can merge the PR.
